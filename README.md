# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
The client for the DriverPass project was interested in building a web-based platform that would act as a resource for individuals preparing for their driving tests. The online system DriverPass envisioned would provide driving training through online practice exams and on-the-road driving appointments with certified driving instructors. The goal of the system is to equip driving students with the resources and confidence they need to ace their driving tests. 

# What did you do particularly well? 
I feel that I did particularly well in putting together the business requirements document. As I was creating this document, I made sure to continuously reference the interview transcript shared as a project resource and paid special attention to the system requirements noted by DriverPass. Once I was able to figure out what requirements could be realistically implemented into the system, I was able to address all DriverPass’ needs all the while giving some great additional recommendations for development. For example, I recommended to DriverPass that they get their notifications and updates from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) via a secure API as well as recommended that they utilize a cloud reporting tool to manage system data. The secure API would add an extra layer of security to the application’s interface when getting information from a third party and the cloud reporting tool would help management gain greater insight into data patterns and trends, and overall system performance.  

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the class diagram I included into my system design document. As of right now, I am still grasping how to use a class diagram to illustrate the different classes, attributes, and methods of a system. Since a class diagram is a high-level overview of how a system should ultimately behave, I’m still learning and need more practice with taking something so complex in nature and breaking it down into a simple, easy-to-digest model.  

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into my system design by constantly referring to the business requirements document and interview transcript to ensure my work aligned with DriverPass’ vision for the system. It is super important to consider the user’s needs when designing as they will serve as the foundation for the design and offer direction. The user’s needs will influence decisions centered around the system’s layout, features, and functionality.  

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
In the future, I will approach designing software similar to how I approached this project. Depending on the software, I will utilize a business requirements document and/or a system design document to help guide me through my analysis and design. Since I would most likely be doing interviews in-person or virtually rather than reading from a transcript of an interview, I would also make sure to take any notes during the meeting so I can ensure I am gathering and keeping in mind what the client requires for a successful system.
